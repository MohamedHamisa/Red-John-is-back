# Red-John-is-back

Red John has committed another murder. This time, he doesn't leave a red smiley behind. Instead, he leaves a puzzle for Patrick Jane to solve. He also texts Teresa Lisbon that if Patrick is successful, he will turn himself in. The puzzle begins as follows.

There is a wall of size 4xn in the victim's house. The victim has an infinite supply of bricks of size 4x1 and 1x4 in her house. There is a hidden safe which can only be opened by a particular configuration of bricks. First, we must calculate the total number of ways the bricks can be arranged to cover the entire wall.
